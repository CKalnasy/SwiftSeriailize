## Usage

```Swift
public struct TestClass {
  var string: String
  var number: Float
  var location: CLLocationCoordinate2D
  var array: [Int]
  var map: [String: AnyObject]
  var set: Set<Float>

  public init(string: String, number: Float, location: CLLocationCoordinate2D, array: [Int], map: [String: AnyObject], set: Set<Float>) {
    self.string = string
    self.number = number
    self.location = location
    self.array = array
    self.map = map
    self.set = set
  }
}

let obj = TestClass(string: "String 1", number: 54, location: CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(39, 49), array: [1, 2, 3], map: ["key1" : ["key2": 43]], set: Set([1.4, 1, 3.6, 66.6]))
let serializedObj = Serializer.serialize(obj)
let deserializedObj = try! Serializer.deserialize(serializedObj)
```

No need to implement protocols in your current custom classes to serialize them.

## Limitations

If a dictionary is passed to the serializer, the key MUST be of type String.

To deserialize a custom class, you must create initializers in the same manor as they are in /SwiftSerialize/Initializer.swift.
Work is in progress to have the entire Initializer class generated by a script.

Since the SwiftSerialize module needs to create instances of custom Swift classes, it must import modules you have created. These modules usually get compiled after this library, leading to the compiler not being able to find some modules and fail building. To overcome this, edit the scheme and compile this target after its dependencies and do not parallelize the build.

## Installation

SwiftSerialize is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "SwiftSerialize"
```

## Running the Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

You'll also need to uncomment the commented lines in /SwiftSerialize/Initializer.swift to run the test cases.

## License

SwiftSerialize is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
